# **DANCE:LDN**

This is my final project for the **Code First Girls - Intro to Web Dev Course**.

I made a responsive website, for a fictional dance studio, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## PROJECT EVALUATION

### What Went Well:
- Styling CSS
- HTML semantic layout
- Links

### Where I Struggled:
- Split navbar without bootstrap (solved by using flex box in parent ul element, so that float right didn't reverse the order of my navbar links)
- Couldn't fix position of navbar, tried changing z index but it still made the navbar see through
- Didn't have time to do JavaScript buttons
- Designed for laptop screen first and had trouble making it responsive (mobile first next time!!!)
- Dropdown navbar without bootstrap (solved with JavaScript adding reponsive class and changing display to block)
- Making buttons round (solved by reducing width)
- Not accepting empty form (solved by required attribute)
- Couldn't centre social media links

### What I Learnt:
- Better understanding of box-model
- Understand what float right does
- Better understanding of cascading styles
- Better understanding of JavaScript logic and event listeners
- Font awesome!
- HTML elements
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript form validation
- HTML tables 
- Mobile first responsive design
