DANCE:LDN

This is my final project for the Code First Girls Intro to Web Dev Course.

I made a responsive website, for a fictional dance studio, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

Must Have:
1. At least 2 HTML pages and one external CSS file
2. Consistent navbar on all pages
3. Styled well
4. All links working
5. Basic user interaction (ex: hover, submit form, action on click)

Nice to Have:
1. Mobile-responsive website
2. Effective use of classes and IDs
3. JavaScript used to enable user interaction

WHAT WENT WELL
- styling CSS
- HTML semantic layout
- links

WHERE I STRUGGLED
- split navbar without bootstrap (solved by using flex box in parent ul element, so that float right didn't reverse the order of my navbar links)
- couldn't fix position of navbar, tried changing z index but it still made the navbar see through
- didn't have time to do JavaScript buttons
- designed for laptop screen first and had trouble making it responsive (mobile first next time!!!)
- dropdown navbar without bootstrap (solved with JavaScript adding reponsive class and changing display to block)
- making buttons round (solved by reducing width)
- not accepting empty form (solved by required attribute)
- couldn't centre social media links

WHAT I LEARNT
- better understanding of box-model
- understand what float right does
- better understanding of cascading styles
- better understanding of JavaScript logic and event listeners
- font awesome!
- HTML elements
- bootstrap
- JavaScript form validation
- HTML tables 
- mobile first responsive design
